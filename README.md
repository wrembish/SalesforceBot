# SalesforceBot
creating a discord bot with Salesforce connection to store data

`**NOTE**` This code requires a node version that includes the new global fetch method `**NOTE**`
* Node 17.5 requires the --experimental-fetch flag to use the feature (**Wasn't tested in 17.5 so keep that in mind**)
* Node 18.6.0 does not require a flag (**This is the version I am developing and testing with**)
